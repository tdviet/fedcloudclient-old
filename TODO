- Adding support for integration with AppDB for images
    + Images are specify with parameter "--appdb <image name in AppDB>"
    + The client will replace the parameter with "--image imageID" before calling Openstack client (like site and VO)

- Separating CLI functions from library functions, keep them in different files, e.g. sites.py and sites_cli.py
    + Better understanding and maintaining the code

- Script for automation of generating certificate bundle and upload to https://github.com/tdviet/python-requests-bundle-certs
    + Just create a new docker image for fedcloud client then upload the certificate bundle from there.
    + Execute the script periodically via cron to keep the certificate bundle always up to date.

- Caching keystone token, reuse it for successive Openstack commands without authentication via CheckIn again
    + Make a dict: key = hash of (site + vo + access token), value = keystone token
    + Before using Openstack command, check the dict reuse the token if found. If not found, generate new token
    and add it to the dict.
