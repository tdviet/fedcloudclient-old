- Adding support for integration with AppDB for images
    + Images are specify with parameter "--appdb <image name in AppDB>"
    + The client will replace the parameter with "--image imageID" before calling Openstack client

- Separating CLI functions from library functions, keep them in different files, e.g. sites.py and sites_cli.py
    + Better understanding and maintaining the code

- Script for automation of generating certificate bundle and upload to https://github.com/tdviet/python-requests-bundle-certs
    + Just create a new docker image for fedcloud client then upload the certificate bundle from there.
    + Execute the script periodically via cron to keep the certificate bundle always up to date.
